To try out this app, navigate to https://chatty-mcchatface.herokuapp.com

OR, if you would rather set it up on your own machine, follow the below:

1. Make sure you have mongo installed, and start an instance on your machine
2. Clone the git repo
3. npm install everything
4. open up a terminal, and cd into the cloned directory, and type in
5. npm start

The app will seem rather underwhelming by yourself, but either get a friend, or open up an incognito Chrome window and talk with yourself. I talk to myself all the time! It's fun! That's not weird at all, right?

Right??

Guys?
